Trust increases accountability and responsibility by encouraging employees to hold themselves and their colleagues accountable for achieving shared goals and upholding organizational values. When employees trust one another, they are more likely to take ownership of their work and make decisions that align with the best interests of the organization.

Trust promotes personal and professional growth by providing opportunities for learning and development. When employees trust their colleagues and leaders, they are more likely to seek out feedback and guidance, take on new challenges, and pursue continuous improvement.
