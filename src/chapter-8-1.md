360-degree feedback involves gathering feedback from multiple sources, including peers, subordinates, and supervisors, to assess an employee's performance. This method can provide a more comprehensive understanding of trust levels within a team or organization.

### Performance Metrics

Performance metrics, such as employee engagement, productivity, and retention rates, can provide insight into the impact of trust-building strategies on overall organizational performance.

### Focus Groups

Focus groups can provide an opportunity for employees to share their thoughts and feelings about trust in the workplace in a more in-depth and interactive setting.

### Observation and Feedback

Leaders can observe employee interactions and provide feedback to assess the level of trust in the workplace. This method can provide real-time feedback and opportunities for immediate improvement.
